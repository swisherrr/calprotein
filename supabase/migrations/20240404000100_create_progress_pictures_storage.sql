-- Create storage bucket for progress pictures
-- Note: This will be created via Supabase dashboard or CLI
-- The bucket should be named 'progress-pictures' with public access enabled

-- Storage policies will be managed through Supabase dashboard
-- or via the storage API, not through direct SQL migrations

-- For now, we'll create a placeholder comment
-- The actual bucket creation should be done via:

-- 2. Set it as public
-- 3. Set file size limit to 5MB
-- 4. Allow image types: jpeg, png, gif, webp
